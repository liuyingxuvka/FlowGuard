## FlowGuard Project Rules

This project uses FlowGuard for non-trivial maintenance, feature work, bug
fixes, refactors, tests, release work, project upgrades, and evidence-sensitive
process changes.

FlowGuard repository:
https://github.com/liuyingxuvka/FlowGuard

Project FlowGuard record:
- Manifest: `.flowguard/project.toml`
- Machine log: `.flowguard/adoption_log.jsonl`
- Human log: `docs/flowguard_adoption_log.md`

Current adoption record:
- FlowGuard package version: `0.36.0`
- FlowGuard schema version: `1.0`

Before non-trivial work:
1. Verify the real package:
   `python -c "import flowguard; print(flowguard.SCHEMA_VERSION)"`
2. Check the installed package version:
   `python -c "import importlib.metadata as m; print(m.version('flowguard'))"`
3. Audit the project record:
   `python -m flowguard project-audit --root .`
4. Compare the installed version with `.flowguard/project.toml`.
5. If the installed version is newer, run:
   `python -m flowguard project-upgrade --root .`
   Then rerun affected models/tests before broad confidence and record the result.
6. If the installed version is older than the project record, stop and upgrade
   the local FlowGuard toolchain before claiming FlowGuard confidence.

Do not create a fake local FlowGuard replacement. Do not claim full FlowGuard
completion from an AGENTS/manifest/log update alone; executable model checks,
tests, replay, and closure evidence still need to be current for the claim.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Route-scoped API groups
FlowGuard SHALL expose grouped helper registries that map stable route/group ids
to public helper names while preserving existing flat API lists.

#### Scenario: Starter registry names are public
- **WHEN** a helper name appears in `ROUTE_STARTER_API`
- **THEN** that helper name is also present in `flowguard.__all__`
- **AND** the helper is importable from `flowguard`

#### Scenario: Advanced route remains available
- **WHEN** a consumer needs full route control
- **THEN** `ROUTE_ADVANCED_API` maps the same route id to the route's full helper
  group or full route inventory

#### Scenario: Starter budgets are enforced
- **WHEN** API surface tests run
- **THEN** each route starter group stays within the configured compact budget
- **AND** broad flat groups are not embedded inside starter groups

### Requirement: Agent-default API surface
FlowGuard SHALL expose a compact agent-default API group and route starter
registry that name the minimal route-first entry points an AI agent should
inspect before expanding into full route or helper groups.

#### Scenario: Agent starts FlowGuard maintenance
- **WHEN** an agent reads the public API registry
- **THEN** `AGENT_DEFAULT_API`, `ROUTE_STARTER_API`, and `ROUTE_ADVANCED_API` are
  available through `API_SURFACE`
- **AND** the existing full public API groups remain available behind full
  surface names

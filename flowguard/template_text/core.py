ADOPTION_LOG_TEMPLATE = """# flowguard Adoption Log

Use this file to keep a human-readable record of model-first work in this
project. Keep machine-readable entries in `.flowguard/adoption_log.jsonl` when
automation is available.

Each entry should record:

- task id;
- task summary;
- trigger reason;
- status: `in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked`, `skipped_with_reason`, or `failed`;
- model files touched;
- checks run;
- elapsed time;
- findings and counterexamples;
- skipped steps and reasons;
- risk evidence ledger summary for final confidence claims;
- friction points;
- next actions.

Do not use this log as a substitute for executable flowguard checks.
Do not treat `in_progress`, `blocked`, `skipped_with_reason`, or `failed` as
successful completion.
"""

MODEL_NOTES_TEMPLATE = """# flowguard Model Notes

## Scope

Describe the workflow boundary being modeled.

## Function Blocks

List each function block as `Input x State -> Set(Output x State)`.

## Invariants

List hard invariants that must not be weakened to pass checks.

## Scenario Review

Record expected-vs-observed scenario outcomes and counterexamples.

## Conformance Replay

Record production adapters, projection decisions, and replay outcomes.

## Known Limits

Record `needs_human_review` and known limitations honestly.
